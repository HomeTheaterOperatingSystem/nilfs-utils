nilfs-utils-2.0.0  Mon Feb 18, 2008 JST

	* add a missing error handling of cleanerd.

nilfs-utils-2.0.0-testing-9  Wed Feb 13, 2008 JST

	* Fixed a hang problem that arose under a near disk full condition.
	* Fixed the problem that a NILFS partition mounted at boot time could
	  not be unmounted manually.  This problem came from the standard
	  behavior of most Linux distributions where the /var/run directory was
	  cleaned after a boot time mount process.  The clean-up job removed
	  the PID file of cleanerd and caused its shutdown failure.
	  The cleanerd and mount/umount programs were fairly changed for this
	  fix; now /etc/mtab is used instead to keep a PID of the cleanerd.

nilfs-utils-2.0.0-testing-4  Thu Oct 11, 2007 JST

	* Add a new argument to nilfs_sync() API to allow utilities (e.g. mkcp)
	  to get the number of generated checkpoint atomically.
	* Fixed an installation error due to a lookup failure of ldconfig
	  that occurs on some distros.

nilfs-utils-2.0.0-testing-3  Tue Jul 24, 2007 JST

	* Allow regular files to be used with mkfs.nilfs2.
	  
	  The current implementation of mkfs.nilfs2 is limited to block devices
	  only, because of the use of the BLKGETSIZE64 ioctl(). That patches
	  allows mkfs.nilfs2 to format regular files, in addition to block
	  devices.
