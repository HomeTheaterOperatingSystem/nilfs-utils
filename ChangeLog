nilfs-utils-2.0.6  Fri Oct 17, 2008 JST

	* fix the cleanerd bug that causes a kernel panic for more than
	  512 snapshots.
	* tighten checks before calling mount syscall.

nilfs-utils-2.0.5  Mon Jul 14, 2008 JST

	* add fake option (-f) to mount.nilfs2.
	* fix a problem related to the fake option support in which a gcpid
	  option remains in /etc/mtab even after ro-remount succeeded.
	* push forward check of /etc/mtab.

nilfs-utils-2.0.4  Fri Jun 20, 2008 JST

	* fix the segmentation fault problem of mount.nilfs2 that occurs
	  if it is invoked without passing through /sbin/mount.
	* allow ro/rw-mount options for mount.nilfs2.
	* apply the patch that renames a member prefix of struct nilfs_suinfo
	  in nilfs_fs.h, which was required to avoid a compile-time error
	  of the nilfs2 kernel module on IA64 machines.
	
nilfs-utils-2.0.3  Thu May 22, 2008 JST

	* fix the problem of 'make dist-bzip2' that it produces a tarball
	  without man pages.  This fixes it by using dist_man_MANS instead
	  of man_MANS.  This release is equivalent to the previous release
	  for the rest.

nilfs-utils-2.0.2  Tue May 20, 2008 JST

	* add man pages for nilfs2 and its utilities.
	* move declaration of nilfs_persistent_group_desc struct into the
	  nilfs_fs.h file.  This structure defines on-disk format of ifile
	  group descriptor, and should be declared in nilfs_fs.h.

nilfs-utils-2.0.1  Mon Mar 24, 2008 JST

	* import changes on nilfs_fs.h to prepare for future extensions.
	* import changes on nilfs_fs.h to avoid checkpatch.pl errors and
	  warnings.
	* fix gcc-4.2 warnings on 64-bit machines
	* remove expanded rcs keywords
	* add .gitignore

nilfs-utils-2.0.0  Mon Feb 18, 2008 JST

	* add a missing error handling of cleanerd.

nilfs-utils-2.0.0-testing-9  Wed Feb 13, 2008 JST

	* Fixed a hang problem that arose under a near disk full condition.
	* Fixed the problem that a NILFS partition mounted at boot time could
	  not be unmounted manually.  This problem came from the standard
	  behavior of most Linux distributions where the /var/run directory was
	  cleaned after a boot time mount process.  The clean-up job removed
	  the PID file of cleanerd and caused its shutdown failure.
	  The cleanerd and mount/umount programs were fairly changed for this
	  fix; now /etc/mtab is used instead to keep a PID of the cleanerd.

nilfs-utils-2.0.0-testing-8  Thu Dec 27, 2007 JST

nilfs-utils-2.0.0-testing-7  Thu Nov 29, 2007 JST
	
	* add cast for 64bit environment.
	* modify some error messages.
	
nilfs-utils-2.0.0-testing-6  Mon Oct 22, 2007 JST

	* Changed the message of "No such device" error printed by mount.nilfs2
	  to make it more understandable.

nilfs-utils-2.0.0-testing-5  Mon Oct 15, 2007 JST

nilfs-utils-2.0.0-testing-4  Thu Oct 11, 2007 JST

	* Add a new argument to nilfs_sync() API to allow utilities (e.g. mkcp)
	  to get the number of generated checkpoint atomically.
	* Fixed an installation error due to a lookup failure of ldconfig
	  that occurs on some distros.

nilfs-utils-2.0.0-testing-3  Tue Jul 24, 2007 JST

	* Allow regular files to be used with mkfs.nilfs2.
	  
	  The current implementation of mkfs.nilfs2 is limited to block devices
	  only, because of the use of the BLKGETSIZE64 ioctl(). That patches
	  allows mkfs.nilfs2 to format regular files, in addition to block
	  devices.

nilfs-utils-2.0.0-testing-2  Tue Jun 20, 2007 JST
	
	* Fixed a problem that the lscp and other userland tools might
	  fail on Ubuntu 6 if a samba mounted partition exists.

nilfs-utils-2.0.0-testing  Wed Jun 13, 2007 JST
	
	* The first release.
	* Implemented the Garbage Collector.
	* Rewrote almost all of the source code.
