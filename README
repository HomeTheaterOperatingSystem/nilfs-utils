* Required packages

 - libuuid-devel or uuid-dev
 - libmount-devel (fedora 14 and later)

* How to compile

 $ ./configure
 $ make

To link mount.nilfs2 and umount.nilfs2 helper programs with libmount
library, install libmount-devel package and run the configure script
with --enable-libmount option:

 $ ./configure --enable-libmount

This option is set by default if /etc/mtab is a symlink to
/proc/mounts in your system.

If your system is a 64-bit architecture and libraries are installed
into /usr/lib64 instead of /usr/lib, change the library directory with
--libdir option:

 $ ./configure --libdir=/usr/lib64


* How to get development sources

 $ cd your-work-directory
 $ git clone git://github.com/nilfs-utils/nilfs-utils.git

Before compiling the development sources, you need to run
autoconf/automake tools.  This is not required for packaged sources
unless you changed the configuration.
 
 $ cd nilfs2-utils
 $ aclocal && autoheader && libtoolize -c --force && automake -a -c && autoconf
