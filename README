* How to compile

 $ ./configure
 $ make

To link mount.nilfs2 and umount.nilfs2 helper programs with libmount
library, install libmount-devel package and run the configure script
with --enable-libmount option:

 $ ./configure --enable-libmount
 $ make

If /etc/mtab is a symlink to /proc/mounts in your system, this option
is set by default.

* How to get development sources

 $ cd your-work-directory
 $ git clone http://git.nilfs.org/nilfs2-utils.git

Before compiling the development sources, you need to run
autoconf/automake tools.  This is not required for packaged sources
unless you changed the configuration.
 
 $ cd nilfs2-utils
 $ aclocal && autoheader && libtoolize -c --force && automake -a -c && autoconf
