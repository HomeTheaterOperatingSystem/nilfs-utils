* Required packages

 - libuuid-devel or uuid-dev
 - libmount-devel (fedora 14 and later)
 - libselinux-devel (if you specify --with-selinux)
 - libblkid-devel

* How to compile

 $ ./configure
 $ make

To link mount.nilfs2 and umount.nilfs2 helper programs with libmount
library, install libmount-devel package and run the configure script
with --enable-libmount option:

 $ ./configure --enable-libmount

This option is set by default if /etc/mtab is a symlink to
/proc/mounts in your system.

If your system is a 64-bit architecture and libraries are installed
into /usr/lib64 instead of /usr/lib, change the library directory with
--libdir option:

 $ ./configure --libdir=/usr/lib64

You can specify --with-selinux option to compile mount.nilfs2
supporting context mount options (-o context=<context>, etc):

 $ ./configure --with-selinux

For mount.nilfs2 built with the --enable-libmount option, support of
the context mount depends on the libmount library and this configure
option is not necessary.


* How to get development sources

 $ cd your-work-directory
 $ git clone git://github.com/nilfs-dev/nilfs-utils.git

Before compiling the development sources, you need to run autogen.sh
script.  This is not required for packaged sources unless you changed
the configuration.
 
 $ cd nilfs-utils
 $ ./autogen.sh
